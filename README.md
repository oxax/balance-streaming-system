# Balance Streaming System
**High-Throughput, Low-Latency Transaction Engine**
A performance-aware Java system that simulates streaming credit/debit ingestion, balance computation, and audit batching ‚Äî designed with modular domain boundaries, observability, and microservice evolution in mind.

### Architectural Layers

![Layered System Architecture](./docs/layered-system-architecture.png)

## Project Objective

Design an application that:

- Ingests and processes real-time credit/debit transactions at 50 TPS (25 credits + 25 debits).  
- Tracks a single account‚Äôs balance in real time, exposed via REST.  
- Every 1,000 transactions, forms batches whose absolute sum ‚â§ ¬£1,000,000.  
- Role-protected API surface (`USER`, `OPS`)
- Minimizes the number of batches per submission to reduce costs.  
- Exposes rich metrics and supports performance validation.

The system emphasizes clean domain boundaries, operational observability, and architectural evolution toward event-driven microservices.

## Features

- Real-time credit/debit transaction ingestion simulation (~50 TPS)
- Atomic balance updates with observability hooks
- Role-based security: OPS and USER scoped access
- Configurable batching algorithm for cost-efficient submissions
- REST APIs for balance, audit stats, and simulation control
- In-memory persistence layer (swappable)
- CI pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Observability-first: REST APIs for transaction, balance, audit stats, and telemetry
- Architected for scalability, clarity, and production-grade CI/CD readiness.

## Audit Batching Behavior

Audit submissions occur automatically after **exactly 1000 processed transactions**, matching the technical exercise requirement.
Batches are assembled using a pluggable `BatchingStrategy`, with two available options:
- `GreedyBatchingStrategy`: inserts transactions sequentially into the first acceptable batch
- `FirstFitDecreasingBatchingStrategy`: sorts transactions by absolute value descending and minimizes batch count using near-optimal bin packing

Each batch:
- Contains only transactions that sum to **‚â§ ¬£1,000,000** (credits and debits treated as positive)
- Is computed using the domain-accurate `Money` abstraction

Upon submission, batch details are printed to the console by the `ConsoleAuditNotifier`, in a format compliant with the spec:

## Validation Tips

- Simulate traffic with http://localhost:8080/simulation/start?count=1000&durationSeconds=10
- Watch http://localhost:8080/audit/summary for average TPS and batch composition
